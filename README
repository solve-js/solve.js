Description of what it does:

Solve.js is intended to be a library to aid in the solution of Ordinary Differential Equations.  In the Solver.js, .modularSolve
is the general numeric solver using the Dormand Prince, Runge-Kutta method.  A different integration method can also be used 
via the integratorMethod input.  

There are test cases to play with in GeneralTests and CorrectnessTests, just run the files and the unit tests will run also.
Verifiers for inputs are also included in verifier.js, to make sure certain inputs are not NaN or are within bounds.

A plotter, titles plotter.html, is also included for demonstration purposes. It uses Flot, an open source jQuery software,
also included.  It has an API and FAQs in the src/flot folder.
